## Past Talks
* `2025-06-10` Category theory reading group: _Category Theory in Context: 4.6. Existence of adjoint functors_.
* `2025-03-19` Algebra preseminar for a talk by Raphaël Paegelow: quiver representations, Hecke algebras and braid groups associated to complex refection groups, block theory for the Ariki–Koike algebra and the corresponding combinatorics of multipartitions and abacai.
* `2025-02-06` [String Diagrams for Hopf Algebras](https://github.com/WilloughbySeago/WilloughbySeago.github.io/blob/main/_files/string-diagrams-for-hopf-algebras.pdf): a half hour talk given as part of the [SMSTC](https://smstc.ac.uk/) course [Hopf Algebras](https://smstc.ac.uk/modules/hopf-algebras). I introduce the use of string diagrams as notation for morphisms in a monoidal category. Then phrase the definition of a Hopf algebra in terms of these diagrams.
* `2024-11-27` Category theory reading group: _Category Theory in Context: 2.2. The Yoneda lemma_.
* `2024-10-25` Example Showcase: a half hour talk given as part of the [AGQ](https://www.agq-cdt.org/) example showcases, talks to other students on the program explaining an example from our area of research. I discussed the boson-fermion corresondence.
