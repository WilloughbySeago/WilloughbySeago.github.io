## Seminars
### ISMP Pre-seminar
I created and organise the [_Integrable Systems and Mathematical Physics_ pre-seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/ismp-pre-seminar), which runs before the [main seminar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/?seriesID=9). This is a short talk aimed at PhD students, given either by the speaker of the seminar or another PhD student. The aim is to give an introduction to the topics of the main seminar, so that we can get the most out of the talk. For details [join the mailing list](http://lists.cent.gla.ac.uk/sympa/info/ismp-preseminar). Note that the pre-seminar is open only to students and post-docs, to allow for more open discussion.

### Fox & Hedgehog Seminar
I am the Glasgow student organiser for the [Fox & Hedgehog seminar](https://www.agq-cdt.org/fox-hedgehog-seminar/). This is a joint seminar series with the University of Edinburgh's maths department and Higgs Centre, and Heriot-Watt's maths department, aimed at a wide range of PhD students from mathematics and mathematical or theoretical physics. The seminars tend to be in the realm of mathematical physics, with a focus on the _process_ of doing mathematics, rather than the results.

## Talks
* `2025-12-10` Algebra preseminar for a talk by Sue Sierra: the classical McKay correspondence
* `2025-12-09` Geometric Representation Theory reading group: affine Weyl groups and Hecke algebras
* `2025-10-29` [Category theory reading group](https://www.agq-cdt.org/training/cohort-reading-groups/intermediate-category-theory/): _Category Theory in Context: 5.5. Recognizing categories of algebras & 5.6. Limits and colimits in categories of algebras_
* `2025-06-10` Category theory reading group: _Category Theory in Context: 4.6. Existence of adjoint functors_.
* `2025-03-19` Algebra preseminar for a talk by Raphaël Paegelow: quiver representations, Hecke algebras and braid groups associated to complex refection groups, block theory for the Ariki–Koike algebra and the corresponding combinatorics of multipartitions and abacai.
* `2025-02-06` [String Diagrams for Hopf Algebras](https://github.com/WilloughbySeago/WilloughbySeago.github.io/blob/main/_files/string-diagrams-for-hopf-algebras.pdf): a half hour talk given as part of the [SMSTC](https://smstc.ac.uk/) course [Hopf Algebras](https://smstc.ac.uk/modules/hopf-algebras). I introduce the use of string diagrams as notation for morphisms in a monoidal category. Then phrase the definition of a Hopf algebra in terms of these diagrams.
* `2024-11-27` Category theory reading group: _Category Theory in Context: 2.2. The Yoneda lemma_.
* `2024-10-25` Example Showcase: a half hour talk given as part of the [AGQ](https://www.agq-cdt.org/) example showcases, talks to other students on the program explaining an example from our area of research. I discussed the boson-fermion correspondence.
