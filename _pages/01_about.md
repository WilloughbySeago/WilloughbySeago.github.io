I'm a first year PhD student at the University of Glasgow.
My research interests can broadly be described as representation theory and its applications to integrable systems.
I'm supervised by [Christian Korff](https://sites.google.com/view/christiankorff/home/) and [Claire Gilson](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/clairegilson).

My research so far has focused on applications of lattice models, inspired by statistical mechanics, to perform combinatorial calculations in the representation theory of various objects, including the symmetric group, quantum groups, Hecke algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and Yang-Baxter algebras.
I'm generally interested in most things algebraic, especially those with interesting representation theory, such as Lie algebras and Hopf algebras.
I find category theory interesting as a unifying language and tool, as well as for its own sake.
Graphical notations have long been an interest of mine, having been used in my masters project as well as being the way I was taught monoidal categories.
I like to strike a balance between abstract theory and hands on calculations, although my heart truely lies with the abstract theory, hands on calculations are necessary to gain understanding and if you actually want to do anything with the theory.

I'm also a [Maclaurin scholar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/research/postgraduate/#themaclaurinscholarship), meaning that I spend 1/3 of my time teaching. So far I've tutored on the first year mathematics course, as well as the third year dynamical systems course. Next year I'll start lecturing!

I'm on the [Algebra, Geometry and Quantum Fields CDT](https://www.agq-cdt.org/), my own research falling mostly in the algebra category with some applications to quantum fields, and the occasional appearnance of some geometry.

Before coming to Glasgow I completed an integrated master's in theoretical physics at the University of Edinburgh. My interests in physics were in the mathematics, particularly representation theory, underlying much of quantum theory. My master's project was on the representation theory of the symmetric group and related representation theory of Lie algebras, and I was supervised by [Tony Kennedy](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/tony-kennedy).
