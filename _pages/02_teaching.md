I'm a [Maclaurin scholar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/research/postgraduate/#themaclaurinscholarship) at the University of Glasgow in the department of Mathematics and Statistics.
This means that I spend 1/3 of my time teaching.

Details on courses at Glasgow can be found [here](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/courselist/?code=MATHS&name=Mathematics).

S1 and S2 mean semester 1 and 2, Y means the whole academic year.
