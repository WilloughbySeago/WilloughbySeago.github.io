## Past Talks
* * [String Diagrams for Hopf Algebras](https://github.com/WilloughbySeago/WilloughbySeago.github.io/blob/main/_files/string-diagrams-for-hopf-algebras.pdf): a half hour talk given as part of the [SMSTC](https://smstc.ac.uk/) course [Hopf Algebras](https://smstc.ac.uk/modules/hopf-algebras). I introduce the use of string diagrams as notation for morphisms in a monoidal category. Then phrase the definition of a Hopf algebra in terms of these diagrams.
* * Example Showcase: a half hour talk given as part of the [AGQ](https://www.agq-cdt.org/) example showcases, talks to other students on the program explaining an example from our area of research. I discussed the boson-fermion corresondence.
