# About Me
I'm a first year PhD student at the University of Glasgow.
My research interests can broadly be described as representation theory and its applications to integrable systems.
I'm supervised by [Christian Korff](https://sites.google.com/view/christiankorff/home/) and [Claire Gilson](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/clairegilson/).

I'm also a [Maclaurin scholar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/research/postgraduate/#themaclaurinscholarship), meaning that I spend 1/3 of my time teaching. So far I've tutored on the first year mathematics course, as well as the third year dynamical systems course. Next year I'll start lecturing!

I'm on the (Algebra, Geometry and Quantum Fields CDT)[https://www.agq-cdt.org/], my own research falling mostly in the algebra category with some applications to quantum fields, and the occasional appearnance of some geometry.

Before coming to Glasgow I completed an integrated master's in theoretical physics at the University of Edinburgh. My interests in physics were in the mathematics, particularly representation theory, underlying much of quantum theory. My master's project was on the representation theory of the symmetric group and related representation theory of Lie algebras, and I was supervised by [Tony Kennedy](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/tony-kennedy).
