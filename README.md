I'm a second year PhD student at the University of Glasgow.
My research interests can broadly be described as representation theory and its applications to integrable systems.
I'm supervised by [Christian Korff](https://sites.google.com/view/christiankorff/home/) and [Claire Gilson](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/clairegilson/).

I'm also a [Maclaurin scholar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/research/postgraduate/#themaclaurinscholarship), meaning that I spend 1/3 of my time teaching. Currently I'm lecturing on the Engineering Mathematics 1 course.
For past teaching see [here](https://willoughbyseago.github.io/teaching).

I'm on the [Algebra, Geometry and Quantum Fields CDT](https://www.agq-cdt.org/), my own research falling mostly in the algebra category with some applications to quantum fields, and the occasional appearance of some geometry.

Before coming to Glasgow I completed an integrated masters in theoretical physics at the University of Edinburgh. My interests in physics were in the mathematics, particularly representation theory, underlying much of quantum theory. My masters project was on the representation theory of the symmetric group and related representation theory of Lie algebras, and I was supervised by [Tony Kennedy](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/tony-kennedy).
